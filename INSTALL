To check the proofs and compile this project, you will need:

* The ocaml compiler http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/index.en.html

* The coq proof assistant (version at least 8.3) http://coq.inria.fr

* the cases tactic (https://github.com/pilki/cases)

Once the cases tactic is downloaded and compiled, modify Makefile.conf
to indicate its path

"make all" will then check the proofs, extract the OCaml code and
compile it to build the simpl "validator" executable.
