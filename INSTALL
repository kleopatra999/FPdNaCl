For quick installation, just run (needs ocaml, not coq)
make quick_validator

To run the tests, first compile the assembly
cd assembly; ocamlbuild asm.native
the tests are in test/oktests and test/notoktests

The validator expects the binary file to be sent on its stdin

To check the proofs and compile this project, you will need:

* The ocaml compiler http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/index.en.html

* The coq proof assistant (version at least 8.3) http://coq.inria.fr

* the cases tactic (https://github.com/pilki/cases)

Once the cases tactic is downloaded and compiled, modify Makefile.conf
to indicate its path

"make all" will then check the proofs, extract the OCaml code and
compile it to build the simpl "validator" executable.
