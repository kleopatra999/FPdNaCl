For quick instalation, just run (needs ocaml, not coq)
> make all_quick

It builds a validator from ocaml sources that were obtained through
extraction and then put on the git repository. To extract those source
files yourself, please see below

To run the tests, first run make all_quick and then
> make test



To check the proofs and compile this project, you will need:

* The ocaml compiler http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/index.en.html

* The coq proof assistant (version at least 8.3) http://coq.inria.fr

* the cases tactic (https://github.com/pilki/cases)

Once the cases tactic is downloaded and compiled, modify Makefile.conf
to indicate its path

>make all
will then check the proofs, extract the OCaml code and
compile it to build the simpl "validator" executable.

The validator expects the binary file to be sent on its stdin

then to run the test with this validator
make test
